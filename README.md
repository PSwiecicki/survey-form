# Survey Form for Volunteers

## About

The idea for this page was taken from [freeCodeCamp][fcc].\
This is a simple survey form site to join to volunteers.\
It is a static page created using HTML, CSS and some JavaScript.\
This website is fully responsive.\
I used JavaScript, to add a custom form validation for required fields.\
If field has got wrong value or is empty then user can see error message under field.

You can check this site [here][siteLink].
